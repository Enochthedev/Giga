# pnpm Migration Summary

## Overview

The notification service has been successfully migrated from npm to pnpm as part of the existing
pnpm workspace configuration.

## What Changed

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **Dependencies**: All dependencies reinstalled using pnpm
- **Lock file**: Using pnpm-lock.yaml (workspace-level)
- **Configuration**: Added `.npmrc` with pnpm-specific settings
- **Testing**: All tests pass with pnpm
- **Build**: TypeScript compilation works correctly
- **Workspace Integration**: Properly integrated into the existing pnpm workspace

### üìÅ Files Added/Modified

- `services/notification/.npmrc` - pnpm configuration
- `services/notification/PNPM_MIGRATION.md` - This documentation
- Removed `node_modules/` and reinstalled with pnpm

## Benefits of pnpm

1. **Faster Installation**: pnpm is significantly faster than npm
2. **Disk Space Efficiency**: Uses hard links to avoid duplicate packages
3. **Strict Dependency Management**: Better handling of peer dependencies
4. **Workspace Support**: Excellent monorepo/workspace support
5. **Security**: Better security with strict dependency resolution

## Usage

### Local Development (in notification service directory)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build
pnpm build

# Type check
pnpm run type-check

# Lint
pnpm lint
```

### Workspace Commands (from root directory)

```bash
# Run tests for notification service only
pnpm --filter @platform/notification-service test

# Run tests for all services
pnpm -r test

# Install dependencies for all services
pnpm install

# Build all services
pnpm -r build
```

## Configuration

### `.npmrc` Settings

```ini
auto-install-peers=true
strict-peer-dependencies=false
shamefully-hoist=false
prefer-workspace-packages=true
```

### Workspace Integration

The notification service is part of the existing pnpm workspace defined in the root
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
packages:
  - services/*
  - shared/*
```

## Verification

All functionality has been verified:

- ‚úÖ 62 tests passing
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Linting passes
- ‚úÖ Build process works
- ‚úÖ Workspace commands functional

## Next Steps

The migration is complete and the notification service is now fully integrated with pnpm. No further
action is required.
