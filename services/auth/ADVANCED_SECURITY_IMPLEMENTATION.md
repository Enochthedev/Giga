# Advanced Security Features Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of advanced security features for the authentication
service as part of task 9 from the implementation plan.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Account Lockout After Failed Login Attempts

**File:** `src/middleware/accountLockout.middleware.ts`

**Features:**

- Progressive lockout system with 5 failed attempts threshold
- 30-minute lockout duration for accounts
- IP-based lockout with higher threshold (10 attempts)
- Progressive delay between failed attempts (exponential backoff)
- Admin functions to manually unlock accounts and IPs
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

**Integration:**

- Added to login route in `src/routes/auth.ts`
- Integrated with auth controller to record/clear failed attempts
- Automatic cleanup on successful login

### 2. IP-Based Access Controls and Geolocation

**File:** `src/middleware/ipAccessControl.middleware.ts`

**Features:**

- IP blacklist/whitelist management
- Suspicious activity pattern detection
- Mock geolocation data with risk scoring
- VPN/Proxy detection simulation
- High-risk location identification
- Temporary blocking for suspicious IPs
- Admin functions for IP management

**Integration:**

- Added to main middleware stack in `src/app.ts`
- Automatic monitoring and logging
- Request analytics and tracking

### 3. Session Management with Concurrent Session Limits

**File:** `src/middleware/sessionManagement.middleware.ts`

**Features:**

- Maximum 5 concurrent sessions per user
- Device fingerprinting for session validation
- 24-hour session timeout
- Session validation middleware
- IP change detection and logging
- Device session tracking in database
- Admin functions for session management

**Integration:**

- Session initialization on successful login
- Session validation on protected routes
- Database integration with DeviceSession model

### 4. Two-Factor Authentication Preparation

**File:** `src/middleware/twoFactorAuth.middleware.ts`

**Features:**

- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) setup generation
- QR code generation for authenticator apps
- 10 backup codes generation
- 2FA requirement checking for sensitive endpoints
- Session-based 2FA verification tracking
- Admin functions for 2FA management

**Dependencies Added:**

- `speakeasy` for TOTP generation
- `qrcode` for QR code generation
- Type definitions for both libraries

**Integration:**

- 2FA requirement checking on sensitive routes
- Preparation for full 2FA implementation

### 5. Enhanced Security Headers and CORS

**File:** `src/middleware/enhancedSecurity.middleware.ts`

**Features:**

- Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Enhanced CORS configuration with origin validation
- Request validation and security monitoring
- Content-Length and payload size validation
- Suspicious header detection
- API response headers for security tracking

**Security Headers Implemented:**

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy for various APIs
- Cross-Origin policies

**Integration:**

- Replaced basic CORS with enhanced version
- Added to main middleware stack
- Security monitoring and logging

## Database Schema Updates

The implementation leverages existing database models:

- `DeviceSession` for session management
- `SecurityEvent` for security logging
- `BlacklistedToken` for token management

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `IP_HASH_SALT`: Salt for IP address hashing (privacy)
- `BACKUP_CODE_SALT`: Salt for 2FA backup code hashing
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Comma-separated list of allowed host headers
- `CSP_REPORT_URI`: URI for CSP violation reports (production)

### Redis Integration

All security features integrate with Redis for:

- Rate limiting and lockout tracking
- Session data caching
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- 2FA setup and verification data

## Testing

**File:** `src/__tests__/advanced-security.test.ts`

**Coverage:**

- Enhanced security middleware functionality
- Request validation and security headers
- CORS configuration
- Error handling for various security scenarios

## Security Considerations

1. **Privacy:** IP addresses are hashed before storage
2. **Rate Limiting:** Progressive delays prevent brute force attacks
3. **Session Security:** Device fingerprinting and IP validation
4. **2FA Preparation:** Secure backup code generation and storage
5. **Headers:** Comprehensive security headers for defense in depth

## Performance Impact

- Minimal overhead from security checks
- Redis caching for fast lookups
- Efficient session validation
- Optimized database queries for session management

## Monitoring and Logging

All security features include comprehensive logging:

- Failed login attempts with IP and user agent
- Suspicious activity detection
- Session anomalies (IP changes, device fingerprint mismatches)
- Security header violations
- Rate limit violations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Full 2FA Implementation:** Complete TOTP and backup code validation
2. **Advanced Geolocation:** Integration with real geolocation services
3. **Machine Learning:** Behavioral analysis for anomaly detection
4. **Real-time Alerts:** Integration with alerting systems
5. **Security Dashboard:** Admin interface for security monitoring

## Compliance

The implementation supports:

- OWASP security best practices
- GDPR compliance (IP hashing, data retention)
- Security headers for modern browsers
- Rate limiting for API protection

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure Redis is properly configured and accessible
2. Set appropriate environment variables for production
3. Configure proper CORS origins for your domains
4. Monitor logs for security events
5. Regularly review and update security configurations

This implementation provides a robust foundation for advanced security features while maintaining
performance and usability.
