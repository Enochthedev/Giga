```

### Gateway Architecture

The service uses an abstraction layer for payment gateways:

```typescript
abstract class PaymentGateway {
  abstract processPayment(request: PaymentRequest): Promise<PaymentResponse>;
  abstract refundPayment(transactionId: string, amount?: number): Promise<Refund>;
  abstract createPaymentMethod(data: any): Promise<PaymentMethod>;
  // ... other methods
}
```

### Failover System

- Automatic gateway selection based on performance metrics
- Circuit breaker pattern for failed gateways
- Configurable failover chains
- Real-time health monitoring

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- payment.test.ts
```

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t giga/payment-service .

# Run container
docker run -p 3004:3004 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..." \
  -e REDIS_URL="redis://..." \
  -e STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_..." \
  giga/payment-service
```
