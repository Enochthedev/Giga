# Payment Service Integration TODO

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete the payment service integration with actual
payment gateways.

## Overview

The payment service has been set up with template implementations for all major payment gateways.
All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved, and the service should build successfully.
However, the actual payment gateway integrations need to be implemented.

## Gateway Integration Tasks

- [ ] Implement gateway priority and failover configuration
- [ ] Add rate limiting and circuit breaker configuration

## Security and Compliance

### Webhook Security

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement proper webhook signature verification for all gateways

## Testing

### Unit Tests

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Write unit tests for each gateway implementation

- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Add tests for webhook processing

### Integration Tests

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Set up test accounts with each payment gateway
- [ ] Create end-to-end payment flow tests
- [ ] Test webhook delivery and processing
- [ ] Add performance and load testing

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Add structured logging for all payment operations
- [ ] Implement correlation IDs for request tracing
- [ ] Add performance metrics and timing
- [ ] Set up log aggregation and alerting

### Metrics

**Tasks:**

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Completed:**

- Basic service architecture and structure
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- Mock implementations for all gateways
- Controller and routing setup
- Error handling framework
- Fraud detection framework (template)
- Gateway failover and health monitoring (template)

üîÑ **In Progress:**

- Template implementations with TODO markers

‚ùå **Pending:**

- All actual gateway integrations
- Database setup and migrations
- Production configuration
- Testing suite
- Documentation completion

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1:** Set up Stripe integration (most common gateway)
2. **Priority 2:** Configure database and Prisma
3. **Priority 3:** Implement webhook handling
4. **Priority 4:** Add comprehensive testing
5. **Priority 5:** Complete remaining gateway integrations

## Notes

- All template files are marked with `(TEMPLATE)` in log messages
- Search for `TODO:` comments throughout the codebase for specific implementation tasks
- The service should compile and run with mock implementations
- Replace mock implementations incrementally to maintain working state
