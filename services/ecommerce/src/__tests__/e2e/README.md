## Test Architecture

### Test Setup and Mocking

- **Database**: Uses test database with Prisma ORM
- **Redis**: Mocked Redis service for cart persistence
- **External Services**: Mocked auth, payment, and notification services
- **Authentication**: Mocked middleware for different user roles
- **Data Factory**: Utility for creating test data

### Test Data Management

- Clean database state before each test
- Isolated test data per test case
- Proper cleanup after test completion
- Realistic test data that mirrors production scenarios

### Error Handling Testing

- Network failures and timeouts
- Service unavailability scenarios
- Data consistency issues
- Race conditions and concurrent operations
- Invalid input handling

### Performance Testing

- Concurrent operation handling
- Large dataset operations
- High-frequency updates
- Response time validation

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npx vitest run src/__tests__/e2e/cart-to-order.e2e.test.ts

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Environment Requirements
