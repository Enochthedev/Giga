# PNPM Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated the hotel service from npm to pnpm package manager.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package.json Updates

- ✅ Added `"packageManager": "pnpm@8.0.0"` field
- ✅ Added `"engines": { "node": ">=18.0.0" }` field
- ✅ Updated script formats to be pnpm-compatible
- ✅ Fixed quote formatting in scripts for consistency

### 2. Dependencies Installation

- ✅ Removed existing `node_modules` directory
- ✅ Installed dependencies using `pnpm install --filter @platform/hotel-service`
- ✅ Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` at workspace root level

### 3. Documentation Updates

- ✅ Updated README.md to specify pnpm 8.0+ as requirement
- ✅ Removed npm as alternative package manager option
- ✅ Maintained all existing installation and usage instructions

### 4. Docker Configuration

- ✅ Verified Dockerfile already uses pnpm (no changes needed)

### 5. Workspace Integration

- ✅ Confirmed hotel service is included in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- ✅ Verified workspace commands work correctly

## Verification Tests

All pnpm commands work correctly:

```bash
✅ pnpm --filter @platform/hotel-service run type-check
✅ pnpm --filter @platform/hotel-service run build
✅ pnpm --filter @platform/hotel-service run lint
✅ pnpm --filter @platform/hotel-service run test (no test files found - expected)
```

## Benefits of PNPM Migration

1. **Consistency**: All services now use the same package manager
2. **Performance**: Faster installs with shared dependencies
3. **Disk Space**: Reduced disk usage through symlinks
4. **Workspace Support**: Better monorepo management
5. **Security**: Stricter dependency resolution

## Next Steps

The hotel service is now fully compatible with pnpm and ready for development. All existing
workflows and commands continue to work as expected.
