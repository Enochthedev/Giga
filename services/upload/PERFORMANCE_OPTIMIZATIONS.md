// Single operations
await cacheService.set('file:123', fileMetadata, 3600);
const metadata = await cacheService.get<FileMetadata>('file:123');

// Batch operations
await cacheService.setMultiple(fileMap, 1800);
const results = await cacheService.getMultiple(fileIds);

// File-specific caching
await cacheService.cacheFileMetadata(metadata);
const cached = await cacheService.getCachedFileMetadata(fileId);
```

  "services": {
    "database": { "status": "healthy", "latency": 5 },
    "redis": { "status": "healthy", "latency": 2 },
    "cache": { "hitRate": 95.5, "memoryUsage": 45000000 }
  },
  "performance": {
    "alerts": 0,
    "trends": {
      "cpuTrend": "stable",
      "memoryTrend": "stable",
