# Architecture Cleanup Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the cleanup needed to align the codebase with the hybrid Supabase + Microservices architecture.

## Current State vs Target State

### ‚úÖ Completed (Supabase-based)
- **Auth Service** ‚Üí Supabase Auth + Edge Functions + SDK
- **File Storage** ‚Üí Supabase Storage + Edge Functions + SDK
- **Notifications** ‚Üí Supabase DB + Edge Functions + SDK

### üî® To Build (Microservices)
- **Ecommerce Service** - Products, Orders, Cart, Vendors
- **Hotels Service** - Properties, Bookings, Inventory
- **Taxi Service** - Rides, Drivers, Vehicles
- **Payment Service** - Transactions, Refunds, Subscriptions
- **Ads Service** - Campaigns, Advertisements

### ‚è≥ To Setup
- **Kong Gateway** - API Gateway for routing

---

## Phase 1: Remove Obsolete Services

### Services to Delete
These services are now handled by Supabase and should be removed:

```bash
# Remove old microservices (replaced by Supabase)
rm -rf services/auth/
rm -rf services/notification/
rm -rf services/upload/
```

**Rationale:**
- `services/auth/` ‚Üí Replaced by Supabase Auth + Edge Functions
- `services/notification/` ‚Üí Replaced by Supabase Edge Functions
- `services/upload/` ‚Üí Replaced by Supabase Storage + Edge Functions

### Services to Keep
- `services/ecommerce/` - Business logic microservice
- `services/hotel/` - Business logic microservice
- `services/taxi/` - Business logic microservice
- `services/payment/` - Business logic microservice
- `services/core/` - Shared utilities (review and update)
- `services/gateway/` - Kong Gateway configuration

---

## Phase 2: Archive Obsolete Specs

### Specs to Archive
Move these to `.kiro/specs/_archived/`:

```bash
mkdir -p .kiro/specs/_archived
mv .kiro/specs/auth-service/ .kiro/specs/_archived/
mv .kiro/specs/notification-service/ .kiro/specs/_archived/
mv .kiro/specs/upload-service/ .kiro/specs/_archived/
```

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] No references to deleted services
- [ ] SDKs are properly integrated
- [ ] Auth middleware works in all services
- [ ] File uploads work via SDK
- [ ] Notifications work via SDK
- [ ] Environment variables are correct
- [ ] Scripts work as expected

---

## Rollback Plan

4. Re-run validation checklist

---

## Notes

- Keep the SDKs in `shared/sdk/` - they are the foundation
- Keep Supabase Edge Functions - they are the new services
- Focus on business logic in microservices
- Use SDKs for all cross-cutting concerns
