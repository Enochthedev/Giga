- üîÑ Upload Service (extract as standalone)

## üìã Next Immediate Actions

### 1. Extract Upload Service (Optional)
**Should we make Upload a standalone service?**

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Reusable across all services (hotels need property photos, taxis need driver photos, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Centralized file management and security
- ‚úÖ Easier to scale and optimize
- ‚úÖ Single point for CDN integration

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Additional service complexity
- ‚ùå Network latency for file operations
- ‚ùå More deployment overhead

**Recommendation**: **Yes, extract it** - file uploads will be needed by every service.

### 2. Create Missing Service Specs
Priority order for spec creation:

1. **Notification Service** (needed by all other services)
2. **Upload Service** (if extracting from auth)
3. **Hotel Service** (core business)
4. **Taxi Service** (core business)
5. **Payment Service** (revenue critical)

## üéØ Upload Service Decision

### Current State
- Upload functionality is embedded in Auth service
- Works well for profile photos
- Limited to auth-related uploads

### Proposed: Standalone Upload Service

```typescript
// Standalone Upload Service Features
interface UploadService {
  // Multi-service support
  uploadProfilePhoto(userId: string, file: File): Promise<UploadResult>;
  uploadPropertyPhoto(propertyId: string, file: File): Promise<UploadResult>;
  uploadVehiclePhoto(vehicleId: string, file: File): Promise<UploadResult>;
  uploadProductPhoto(productId: string, file: File): Promise<UploadResult>;
  
  // Advanced features
  generateThumbnails(imageId: string, sizes: number[]): Promise<string[]>;
  optimizeForWeb(imageId: string): Promise<string>;
  generatePresignedUrl(uploadType: string): Promise<PresignedUrl>;
  
  // Management
  deleteFile(fileId: string): Promise<boolean>;
  getFileMetadata(fileId: string): Promise<FileMetadata>;
}
```

### Benefits of Standalone Upload Service
1. **Hotel Service**: Property photos, amenity images
2. **Taxi Service**: Driver photos, vehicle images  
3. **Ecommerce**: Product images (currently missing!)
4. **Advertising**: Ad creative uploads
5. **All Services**: Document uploads, verification photos

## ü§î Your Decision Needed

**Question 1**: Should we extract Upload as a standalone service?
- ‚úÖ **Recommended: Yes** - Every service will need file uploads

**Question 2**: Which service spec should we create first?
- Option A: Upload Service (if extracting)
- Option B: Notification Service (infrastructure)
- Option C: Hotel Service (core business)

**Question 3**: Do you want to focus on:
- Creating missing specs first, or
- Completing implementation of existing specs (API Gateway)?

Let me know your preference and I'll create the appropriate specs!
