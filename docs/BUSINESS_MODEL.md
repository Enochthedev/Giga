# Multi-Sided Platform Business Model

## ðŸŽ¯ Platform Overview

Our multi-sided platform creates value by connecting multiple user types across four core services,
enabling network effects and cross-service monetization opportunities.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Unified Experience**: One account, multiple roles, seamless switching
- **Network Effects**: Users benefit from being both consumers and providers
- **Cross-Service Synergies**: Drivers can shop, vendors can advertise, hosts can book other
  properties
- **Reduced Friction**: Single wallet, unified payments, shared reputation

## ðŸ‘¥ User Ecosystem

### Multi-Role User System

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  roles: RoleName[]; // Can have multiple roles simultaneously
  activeRole: RoleName; // Current context
  profiles: {
    customer?: CustomerProfile;
    vendor?: VendorProfile;
    driver?: DriverProfile;
    host?: HostProfile;
    advertiser?: AdvertiserProfile;
  };
}
```

### Role Distribution Strategy

- **Primary Role**: 70% of users start with one primary role
- **Secondary Roles**: 40% adopt a second role within 6 months
- **Power Users**: 15% become multi-role power users (3+ roles)
- **Cross-Service Usage**: 60% use multiple services within first year
