# Codebase Cleanup Summary

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Planning Complete - Ready for Execution

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Documentation Created ‚úÖ

#### New Architecture Documents
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md`** - Comprehensive 10-phase cleanup plan
- **`docs/MIGRATION_TO_SUPABASE.md`** - Step-by-step migration guide with code examples
- **`CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

#### Updated Documents
- **`.kiro/steering/coding-standards.md`** - Added Supabase SDK usage guidelines and architecture rules

### 2. Specs Archived ‚úÖ

Moved obsolete specs to `.kiro/specs/_archived/`:
- `auth-service/` - Replaced by Supabase Auth
- `notification-service/` - Replaced by Supabase Notifications
- `upload-service/` - Replaced by Supabase Storage

Created `.kiro/specs/_archived/README.md` explaining why these were archived.

---

## What Needs to Be Done

### Phase 1: Remove Obsolete Services (HIGH PRIORITY)

These services are now handled by Supabase and should be deleted:

```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è BACKUP FIRST!
we 

# Remove obsolete services
rm -rf services/auth/
rm -rf services/notification/
rm -rf services/upload/
```

**Impact:**
- Removes ~3 complete microservices
- Frees up significant codebase space
- Eliminates maintenance burden

### Phase 2: Update Existing Services (HIGH PRIORITY)

Services that need SDK integration:

#### Ecommerce Service (`services/ecommerce/`)
- [ ] Add `@giga/auth-sdk` for authentication
- [ ] Add `@giga/file-storage-sdk` for product images
- [ ] Add `@giga/notifications-sdk` for order notifications
- [ ] Remove any custom auth logic
- [ ] Update routes with auth middleware
- [ ] Update tests

#### Hotel Service (`services/hotel/`)
- [ ] Add `@giga/auth-sdk` for authentication
- [ ] Add `@giga/file-storage-sdk` for property images

- [ ] `.kiro/specs/hotel-service/` - Add SDK usage examples
- [ ] `.kiro/specs/taxi-service/` - Add SDK usage examples
- [ ] `.kiro/specs/payment-service/` - Add SDK usage examples
- [ ] `.kiro/specs/ads-service/` - Add SDK usage examples
- [ ] `.kiro/specs/api-gateway/` - Update for Kong Gateway

### Phase 4: Update Documentation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- [ ] `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` - Add Supabase setup
- [ ] `docs/SERVICE_ORCHESTRATION.md` - Update flows
- [ ] `docs/SERVICE_ROADMAP.md` - Update status
- [ ] `README.md` - Update project overview

### Phase 5: Update Scripts (LOW PRIORITY)

Scripts that need updating:

- [ ] `run-services.sh` - Remove old services
- [ ] `start-services.sh` - Remove old services
- [ ] `test-services.sh` - Remove old services
- [ ] Create `setup-supabase.sh` - Initialize Supabase locally
- [ ] Create `deploy-edge-functions.sh` - Deploy Edge Functions

### Phase 6: Clean Dependencies (LOW PRIORITY)

- [ ] Update root `package.json` - Remove old service references
- [ ] Run `pnpm install` to clean up
- [ ] Update service `package.json` files with SDK dependencies

## Execution Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Do Now)
1. ‚úÖ Review this summary
2. ‚úÖ Review `docs/ARCHITECTURE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md`
3. ‚úÖ Review `docs/MIGRATION_TO_SUPABASE.md`
4. Create backup branch: `git checkout -b backup-before-cleanup`

### Next Steps (This Week)
1. Delete obsolete services (`services/auth/`, `services/notification/`, `services/upload/`)
2. Update one service as a pilot (recommend `services/ecommerce/`)
3. Test the pilot service thoroughly
4. Document any issues or learnings

### Following Weeks
1. Update remaining services (hotel, taxi, payment)
2. Build ads service using the new pattern
3. Update all documentation
4. Update scripts and CI/CD
5. Setup Kong Gateway

## Benefits of This Cleanup

### Reduced Complexity
- 3 fewer microservices to maintain
- Centralized auth, storage, and notifications
- Simpler deployment and scaling

### Improved Developer Experience
- Easy-to-use SDKs for common tasks
- Consistent patterns across services
- Better documentation

### Better Performance
- Supabase's managed infrastructure
- Built-in caching and optimization
- Reduced inter-service communication

### Cost Savings
- Fewer services to host and maintain
- Supabase's free tier for development
- Reduced infrastructure complexity

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
- Create backup branch before any deletions
- Keep archived specs for reference
- Document all changes

### Testing Strategy
- Update one service at a time
- Comprehensive testing after each update
- Monitor for issues in staging

### Rollback Plan
- Keep old services in backup branch
- Can revert if major issues arise
- Gradual migration approach

---

## Questions to Consider

1. **Are there any dependencies on the old services?**
   - Check if any external systems call the old services
   - Update API documentation for clients

2. **Do we need to migrate existing data?**
   - User data ‚Üí Already in Supabase
   - Files ‚Üí May need migration script
   - Notifications ‚Üí Historical data migration?

3. **What about existing deployments?**
   - Plan for zero-downtime migration
   - Update load balancer/gateway configuration
   - Monitor during transition

4. **Are there any custom features in old services?**
   - Review before deletion
   - Ensure Supabase + SDKs cover all use cases
   - Document any gaps

---

## Success Criteria

The cleanup is successful when:
- [ ] All obsolete services are removed
- [ ] All remaining services use Supabase SDKs
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] No references to deleted services
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines updated
- [ ] Staging environment working
- [ ] Production deployment successful

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this summary** and the detailed plans
2. **Create a backup branch** before making changes
3. **Start with Phase 1** - Delete obsolete services
4. **Update one service** as a pilot (recommend ecommerce)
5. **Test thoroughly** before proceeding
6. **Continue with remaining phases** systematically

---

## Support

For questions or issues during cleanup:
- Review `docs/ARCHITECTURE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` for detailed steps
- Review `docs/MIGRATION_TO_SUPABASE.md` for code examples
- Check SDK documentation in `shared/sdk/*/README.md`
- Review Supabase Edge Functions in `supabase/functions/`

---

## Conclusion

This cleanup aligns the codebase with the hybrid Supabase + Microservices architecture, reducing complexity while maintaining all functionality. The SDKs and Edge Functions are already built and tested, making this primarily a refactoring and cleanup effort.

**Estimated Effort:**
- Phase 1 (Delete services): 1 hour
- Phase 2 (Update services): 2-3 days per service
- Phase 3-6 (Docs, scripts, etc.): 1-2 days

**Total:** ~2-3 weeks for complete cleanup

**Status:** Ready to begin execution üöÄ
