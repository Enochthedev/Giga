## üîÑ Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate: Update Ecommerce Service (Pilot)

This will serve as the template for other services.

**Tasks:**

1. Install SDKs: `@giga/auth-sdk`, `@giga/file-storage-sdk`, `@giga/notifications-sdk`
2. Create auth middleware using SDK
3. Update routes with authentication
4. Add file upload for product images
5. Add notification support for orders
6. Update tests
7. Verify build and tests pass

**Why Ecommerce First?**

- Most complete service
- Has all use cases (auth, files, notifications)
- Can serve as reference for others

### Then: Update Remaining Services

1. Hotel Service
2. Taxi Service
3. Payment Service

### Finally: Documentation & Cleanup

1. Update all specs
2. Update root documentation
3. Clean up dependencies
4. Update scripts
